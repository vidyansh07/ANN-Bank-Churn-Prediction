📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

An interactive Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

🔗 Built with Streamlit | TensorFlow | Scikit-learn

📊 Features

🔮 Predict customer churn probability 📈 Displays risk percentage (Churn vs Retention) 🎯 Clean and interactive UI dashboard ⚡ Real-time predictions using trained ANN model

🧠 How It Works

The model is trained on customer data and uses the following preprocessing steps:

📌 Notes Model predicts churn probability based on user input Threshold logic: ≥ 50% → High Risk (Churn) < 50% → Low Risk (Retention) Ensure all artifact files exist before running the app 👨‍💻 Author
